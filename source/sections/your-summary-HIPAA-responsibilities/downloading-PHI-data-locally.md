# Dowloading PHI data locally

The rule is very simple. You do not need access to PHI data. Do not download, store or open any communication containing PHI.

An exception to this rule is when, as part of resolving a technical support issue for a Customer, it is required to download some data in order to test data downloading functionality in the software. In these circumnstances, approval from the Customer must be obtained in writing (e.g. email), and the minimum amount of data required to resolve the support issue should be downloaded. The workstationâ€™s disk where data will be download must be encrypted, and the data must be securely destroyed as soon as the support issue is resolved, or as soon as the data is no longer needed to fix the support issue. Under no circumstances will this data be shared outside to any third parties without prior consent from the owner of the data.
